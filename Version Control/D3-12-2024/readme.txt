This is two projects. One contains a server demo, the other a client demo.
Currently the server is launched, the client(s) connects then any key press on client end is sent to server which deciphers the button press
and sends information back to the individual client.

The next step is to have (a) the clients sync up (everything sent to one client updates both) and then (b) each client's character is separate.

Then I need to take this concept and implement it on our existing game.
